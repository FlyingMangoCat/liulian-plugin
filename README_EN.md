* Dear users, good evening. Some may know what "Liulian" (Durian) originally represented. But now, Liulian represents strength, uniqueness, and natural armor. We will bid farewell to the past together. The future Liulian belongs exclusively to the Flying Mango Cat, the Liulian Project Team, to Xiao Rui, Xingguang, Apple Cat, and every user friend! Liulian's future is defined by ourselves, and Liulian's meaning belongs only to us!

                     ——Flying Mango Cat & Liulian Project Team
